## Overview
An Android app that pulls data from Ruter and displays realtime vehicle location on a map. Everything inside of the `library` package can be used as a standalone library that wraps the Ruter APIs and returns parsed data. It means you can take the standalone Java library and port it to something other than an Android app.

#### How accurate is it?
Sort of accurate. The data doesn't have enough information to be precise but it's accurate-ish. It looks fun though!

#### Should I judge you based on this code?
This project started out in 2013 when I was looking to put an Android app into the Play store. I had done a lot of messing around but never committed to getting something I was happy with published. A lot has changed since 2013 and I haven't given this code the love it deserves.

When making this open-source I was amazed to see how poor some of this code was; Android has moved on a lot and I have learned a lot. I fixed some of the worst aspects but there are still plenty of improvements to make.
